## Introduction  
This is a p5js program, open index.html to start.  
This uses the sample algorithm, but there's still space for improvement, I didn't complete the part where it finds the  
shortest route to the end.  
## How to start and end  
Press "s" then click to place the starting point.  
Press "e" then click to place the ending point.  
Press "w" for "wall", click or drag to place them.  
Once you're satisfied with your work, press "b" to begin.  
 ## ENJOY!   :thumbsup:
